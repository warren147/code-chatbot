## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. **Docker and Docker Compose**  
   Docker enables containerization of applications, while Docker Compose allows orchestration of multi-container setups.

   - **Docker:** [Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - **Docker Compose:** [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


2. **Node.js (Optional)**  
   If you plan to run the frontend and backend without Docker for development purposes.
   
   - **Node.js:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Executing Program

Create a .env file containing:
```
# backend/.env

PORT=your_port
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment_here
```

then run:
```docker-compose up -d --build```


## Inspiration

I was recently put into a project with huge extensive codebase and complex code without sufficient documentation and comments, making it really difficult for me to fully understand. This inspired me to create Code Chatbot which utilizes the implementation of RAG that allow users to upload multiple files and chat with them. 

## Future Development

Multiple chat rooms, better looking UI, real-time collaboration with multiple users, integrate tools for deeper code analysis
